Writing papers a sentence at a time can help convey ideas very simply.  When it comes time to join them all together, however, you can use a capital 'J'.  This will then link every sentence in a 'paragraph' together.  It should be done before a set of text is pasted into a word processor.  That makes it easy to edit sentences and use a program like git to keep track of ideas.  Pretty cool, huh?
